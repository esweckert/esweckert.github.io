Hej, my name is Thomas

I am an advisor in business and technology transformation. I specialize in helping companies getting control over their data, laying the foundation for a seamless SAP-enabled business transformation. With over 20 years of immersion in the SAP ecosystem and business transformation projects, I’ve seen firsthand the hurdles and triumphs of adequate data. My journey began as an Finance Business Consultant, evolving through various roles to where I am today - working closely with my clients on their journey towards the „intelligent enterprise“, ensuring their data receives the attention it deserves.  

What I do: - Data related and data driven change management - SAP S/4HANA Data Migration: Planning, Management, Execution, Training - Data cleansing and enrichment: Planning, Management, Execution, Training - Data Quality: Strategy, Execution, Training, Coaching - Data Governance: Strategy, Execution, Training, Coaching - Data Management Maturity Assessments - Data & Information Architecture  

The result? Confidence in your data, processes and transformation projects.  

Ready to tackle your next data challenge with more clarity? Let’s connect and embark on that journey together. Your path to mastering your master data starts with a conversation.
